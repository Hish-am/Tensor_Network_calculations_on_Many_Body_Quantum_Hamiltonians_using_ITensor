# Tensor_Network_calculations_on_Multibody_Quantum_Hamiltonians_using_ITensor
Using the powerful ITesnor lib. to run Tensor Network operations including DMRG on a 20-spin chain (as an MPS) under the Heisenberg Hamiltonian (as an MPO) to extract ground state energy and von-Neumann entanglement entropy around an arbitrary bond position.
